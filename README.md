# Phillip-Hue-Swift-Wrapper
Basic functionality to access various Hue API endpoints

During the development of a another app that makes use of Phillip Hues, I've found the iOS SDK and Swift support for that SDK to be less than ideal. Given that, I thought it best to make use of the API endpoints Hue provides and simply make a wrapper as a work around.

This is a work in progress.
